# Specification Quality Checklist: BC-UR Playground with Multi-Format Conversion and QR Code Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Passed Items

✅ **Content Quality**: Specification is written in business terms focusing on user value:
- User stories describe developer/user needs without mentioning specific frameworks
- Requirements use "system MUST" language without implementation details
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Users can paste a UR string and see decoded formats within 1 second")

✅ **No Clarifications Needed**: All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved based on user feedback

✅ **Testable Requirements**: All functional requirements are verifiable:
- FR-001: "System MUST automatically detect input format" - testable by providing various formats
- FR-007: "System MUST display grid showing all original UR parts" - testable by visual inspection
- FR-043: "System MUST provide UI for defining custom registry types" - testable by using the UI

✅ **Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria**: All success criteria avoid implementation details:
- SC-001: "within 1 second" (measurable time, no mention of how)
- SC-002: "see grid update in real-time" (user outcome, not technical metric)
- SC-003: "100% of standard ur-registry items" (business metric)

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**:
- 7 user stories covering all major workflows (P1-P7 priority)
- 61 functional requirements across 8 categories
- 13 edge cases identified
- 18 success criteria defined

✅ **Clear Boundaries**:
- Out of Scope section clearly defines what's NOT included (12 items)
- Constraints section defines technical limitations (12 constraints)
- Dependencies section lists all external requirements

### Recommendations

**Ready for Planning**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

**Strong Points**:
1. User stories are independently testable with clear priorities
2. Requirements organized by functional area for easy navigation
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage
4. Clear assumptions documented

**No Issues Found**: All checklist items pass validation.
