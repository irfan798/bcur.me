# Feature Specification: BC-UR Playground

**Feature Branch**: `002-bc-ur-playground`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Focus of this project is to allow (mostly) developers and users to have a playground with bc-ur library and animated qr codes, See what is contained in the qr codes and multi-urs, check if the type is in the `ur-registry` be able to debug decoded cbor content. Live play with Registry Items on console and check what is it capable of. If there is an error in their implementation be the source of truth for those libraries. It should also work in mobile browsers because its easier to access camera on you phone for decoding animated qr codes that are composed of multi-part UR code. Also to understand what data is encoded on their wallet that uses urs and make sure their wallet is not sending their mnemonic or private keys etc. Basically online implementation of https://github.com/blockchaincommons/URDemo"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: When users set `repeatAfterRatio = 0` (infinite looping), what should happen with animation playback and download/export behavior? â†’ A: Loop animation indefinitely but disable downloads, suppress full text list, and present streaming preview that updates as each next part is requested.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Format Conversion & Inspection (Priority: P1)

Developers and users need to convert between different UR representations (UR string, bytewords, hex, CBOR) and inspect decoded content to understand what data is encoded in their URs.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - without format conversion and inspection, the tool has no value. This is the foundation for all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pasting a UR string and seeing it converted to hex, bytewords, and decoded CBOR views. Delivers immediate value for understanding UR contents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid single-part UR string, **When** user pastes it into the converter, **Then** system displays UR type, hex representation, bytewords (minimal/standard/URI styles), and decoded CBOR in multiple views (JSON, diagnostic, commented, JavaScript)
2. **Given** hex input, **When** user provides UR type, **Then** system generates valid UR string and bytewords
3. **Given** multi-part UR text (multiple lines with ur: prefix), **When** user pastes it, **Then** system assembles parts using fountain decoder and displays decoded content with completion progress
4. **Given** decoded CBOR content, **When** user inspects registry type, **Then** system shows whether type is registered in ur-registry and links to documentation
5. **Given** invalid input, **When** conversion fails, **Then** system shows specific error message indicating what broke and at which pipeline stage

---

### User Story 2 - Multi-Part UR Generation & Animated QR Display (Priority: P2)

Developers need to generate multi-part fountain-encoded URs and display them as animated QR codes to test wallet integrations and understand fountain encoding behavior.

**Why this priority**: Essential for testing wallet QR scanning implementations and understanding how multi-part URs work. Complements the converter by showing the encoding side.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking a hex/UR input, generating multi-part URs, and displaying animated QR code. Delivers value for wallet developers testing QR scanning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a single UR or hex input, **When** user specifies fountain encoder parameters (max fragment length, min fragment length, sequence number, repeat ratio), **Then** system generates multi-part URs and displays them as text or streaming preview as appropriate
2. **Given** generated multi-part URs, **When** user configures QR settings (size, error correction, frame rate), **Then** system displays animated QR code with current part indicator, looping indefinitely when repeatAfterRatio = 0
3. **Given** animated QR running, **When** user clicks play/pause/restart controls, **Then** animation responds immediately
4. **Given** generated parts with finite repeats, **When** user clicks download, **Then** system provides options to export as text file or frames; if repeatAfterRatio = 0, system disables downloads and shows guidance to pick a finite repeat
5. **Given** invalid fountain parameters (e.g., min > max), **When** user attempts generation, **Then** system shows validation error before attempting encoding

---

### User Story 3 - QR Scanner & Fountain Decoder (Priority: P1)

Mobile users need to scan animated QR codes from wallets/devices using their phone camera to decode multi-part URs and understand what data is being transmitted.

**Why this priority**: Primary use case - mobile camera access for scanning animated QR codes. This is why mobile browser support is critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scanning an animated QR code with phone camera and seeing decoded UR content with progress tracking. Delivers immediate value for users inspecting wallet QR codes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens scanner tab on mobile browser, **When** camera permission is granted, **Then** live video preview appears with QR detection overlay
2. **Given** animated multi-part QR code on screen, **When** camera scans each frame, **Then** system displays grid showing decoded blocks (green=decoded, gray=pending) with completion percentage
3. **Given** fountain decoding in progress, **When** user scans seen blocks again, **Then** grid shows seen blocks without re-processing, progress continues smoothly
4. **Given** decoding reaches 100%, **When** final block is received, **Then** system auto-forwards assembled UR to converter tab and displays full decoded content
5. **Given** user is scanning crypto-seed UR, **When** camera detects different UR type (e.g., PSBT), **Then** system displays warning about type mismatch and offers to reset decoder state
6. **Given** decoding in progress, **When** user clicks reset button, **Then** fountain decoder state clears and scanner ready for new UR sequence
7. **Given** camera permission denied, **When** user accesses scanner, **Then** system shows clear error message with instructions to grant permission

---

### User Story 4 - Registry Browser & Type Inspection (Priority: P3)

Developers need to browse all registered UR types, view their CDDL schemas, and verify whether scanned URs match known registry types.

**Why this priority**: Helpful for understanding the ur-registry ecosystem and debugging unknown types, but not essential for core conversion/scanning workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by browsing registry list, viewing CDDL for a type (e.g., crypto-seed), and comparing against decoded UR. Delivers value for developers learning the registry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens registry browser, **When** page loads, **Then** system displays list of all registered types with tags, URType names, and CDDL summaries
2. **Given** a registered type (e.g., crypto-hdkey), **When** user clicks to expand, **Then** system shows full CDDL with syntax highlighting and link to official documentation
3. **Given** decoded UR with type, **When** user checks registry, **Then** system highlights matching registry entry or shows "unregistered type" message
4. **Given** multiple ur-registry packages (core, crypto, etc.), **When** browsing, **Then** system groups types by package with clear labels

---

### User Story 5 - Registry Item Interactive Console (Priority: P3)

Developers need to dynamically create and test registry items in the browser console to experiment with CBOR encoding/decoding and understand registry item behavior.

**Why this priority**: Advanced developer feature for testing custom registry types. Useful but not essential for most users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a registry item via console API, encoding data, and seeing CBOR output. Delivers value for developers building custom registry items.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user decodes UR to JavaScript view, **When** output is displayed, **Then** system shows hint to open browser console with example commands (e.g., `window.registryPlayground.createItem(...)`)
2. **Given** developer opens console, **When** typing `window.registryPlayground`, **Then** autocomplete shows available methods (createItem, encode, decode, validate)
3. **Given** developer creates custom registry item in console, **When** instance is created, **Then** object auto-logs to console with expandable structure showing all properties and methods
4. **Given** custom registry item, **When** developer calls `.encode()`, **Then** system returns CBOR hex and displays in console for copy/paste
5. **Given** CBOR hex, **When** developer calls `window.registryPlayground.decode(hex)`, **Then** system returns JavaScript object with decoded structure

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user scans partially corrupted multi-part UR with some frames missing indefinitely?
  - System shows progress stuck at X%, displays which blocks are pending, allows manual reset
  
- What happens when user pastes extremely long hex input (>100KB)?
  - System shows warning about processing time, uses debouncing, provides cancel option

- What happens when camera access is revoked mid-scan?
  - System detects permission change, pauses scanning, shows re-grant instructions

- What happens when user switches browser tabs during animated QR generation?
  - Animation pauses (browser throttling), resumes on tab focus, no data loss

- What happens when decoded CBOR contains unknown/invalid registry type?
  - System displays "unknown type" with raw CBOR, offers manual type override option

- What happens when user tries to scan QR code in desktop browser (no camera)?
  - System detects no camera available, shows fallback message to use mobile or manual UR paste
- What happens when user sets repeatAfterRatio = 0 for generation?
  - System loops the animation infinitely, shows a streaming text preview that updates per part, disables exports, and prompts the user to choose a finite repeat value for downloads

## Notes & Rationale *(optional)*

### Design Decisions

**Why mobile-first?**  
Camera access is easier on mobile devices. Primary use case is scanning wallet QR codes with phone camera. Desktop users can still use converter and generator, but scanning requires mobile.

**Why separate tabs instead of single page?**  
Each workflow (convert, generate, scan, inspect) is distinct. Tabs reduce cognitive load, enable lazy loading, and allow focused UX per workflow.

**Why fountain decoder grid shows decoded blocks vs seen blocks?**  
UrFountainDecoder tracks two states: seenBlocks (mixed fragments scanned) and decodedBlocks (original blocks resolved via XOR reduction). Users care about progress toward completion, which is decodedBlocks. Seen blocks can be infinite with fountain codes, decoded blocks are fixed count.

**Why console playground instead of built-in registry item creator?**  
Developers already familiar with browser DevTools. Building duplicate console UI adds complexity. Exposing window.registryPlayground with hints is simpler, more flexible, and follows developer expectations.

**Why no sensitive data warnings?**  
Users inspecting wallet URs already know what's sensitive. False positives/negatives create confusion. Tool's role is to decode and display, user decides what's private.

**Why source of truth emphasis?**  
BC-UR.me aims to be the reference implementation for debugging library issues. When developers encounter encoding problems, they should be able to verify behavior against this tool. 100% library method usage (no reimplementation) ensures accuracy.

**Why is CDDL validation a future enhancement instead of MVP?**  
CDDL validation adds significant complexity (parser, editor, syntax highlighting, validation engine). MVP focuses on core workflows: convert, scan, inspect. CDDL validation enhances the registry playground but isn't essential for primary use cases (understanding what's in URs, testing wallet QR codes). Post-MVP implementation allows focus on getting core functionality right first, then adding advanced developer tools.

**Why automatic validation instead of on-demand?**  
Real-time validation provides immediate feedback when decoding URs. Developers don't need to remember to click "Validate" - they see schema compliance status instantly. Inline highlighting (mismatched fields) + summary panel (all errors) gives both quick visual feedback and detailed diagnostics. Performance impact mitigated by debouncing and caching validation results.

### Technical Constraints

- **Browser APIs**: Requires modern browser with ES modules, Clipboard API, MediaDevices API (camera), CSS Grid
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera access requires secure context (HTTPS or localhost)
- **No iOS Safari Camera Constraints**: iOS Safari may have camera API limitations (requires testing)
- **QR Library Selection**: Must support alphanumeric mode explicitly (not all libraries do)
- **Registry Package Size**: All ur-registry packages add up to significant bundle size (consider lazy loading)

### Open Questions

None - all critical decisions resolved via user clarifications (Q1-A: single comprehensive spec, Q2-C: console hints, Q3-C: decoded blocks grid).
