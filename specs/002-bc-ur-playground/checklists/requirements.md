# Specification Quality Checklist: BC-UR Playground

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

### Content Quality Review

- ✅ **No implementation details**: Spec focuses on capabilities (UR.pipeline, BytewordEncoding) without discussing code structure, file organization, or specific frameworks
- ✅ **User value focus**: All user stories explain "why this priority" and "what value it delivers"
- ✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for developers AND users, explains concepts in plain language (e.g., "fountain encoding" explained via behavior, not algorithms)
- ✅ **All mandatory sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all complete

### Requirement Completeness Review

- ✅ **No clarification markers**: All critical decisions resolved via user input (Q1-A: single spec, Q2-C: console hints, Q3-C: decoded blocks grid)
- ✅ **Testable requirements**: Every FR has concrete "MUST" statement with measurable criteria (e.g., FR-026 specifies UrFountainDecoder.getProgress() as testable metric)
- ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC have quantifiable targets (500ms conversion time, 30 seconds scan time, 95% success rate, etc.)
- ✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Criteria describe user outcomes (scan time, success rate) not implementation metrics (API response time, cache hit rate)
- ✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: 5 user stories with 26 total acceptance scenarios covering happy paths, edge cases, error scenarios
- ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases with specific resolution strategies
- ✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: Out of Scope section explicitly excludes sensitive data detection, image upload, wallet functionality, server-side processing
- ✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Comprehensive lists of external dependencies (bc-ur, ur-registry, QR libraries) and assumptions (browser support, ESM modules, mobile-first)

### Feature Readiness Review

- ✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: All 52 functional requirements have specific MUST statements with testable outcomes
- ✅ **Primary flows covered**: Format conversion (P1), QR scanning (P1), multi-UR generation (P2), registry browsing (P3), console playground (P3) prioritized by user value
- ✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria with quantified targets align with functional requirements
- ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Spec references library APIs (UrFountainEncoder, UrFountainDecoder) as black boxes, doesn't prescribe implementation details

## Notes

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive user scenarios**: 5 independently testable user stories with clear priorities
2. **Detailed fountain decoder requirements**: FR-024 through FR-033 precisely specify seenBlocks vs decodedBlocks tracking (addresses user's Q3 clarification)
3. **Mobile-first emphasis**: Multiple requirements (FR-021, FR-046, FR-047) ensure mobile browser support is first-class
4. **Source of truth positioning**: SC-010 and Notes section clearly establish tool as reference implementation for bc-ur library debugging
5. **Explicit exclusions**: Out of Scope section prevents feature creep (no sensitive data detection, no image upload, no wallet functionality)
6. **CDDL validation roadmap**: Moved from "Explicitly Excluded" to "Future Enhancements (High-Priority Post-MVP)" with detailed specifications for full CDDL editor, automatic validation (real-time), validation against all types (registry + custom schemas), inline error highlighting + summary panel

### Areas of Excellence

- **Grid visualization clarity**: FR-025 and FR-027 distinguish decoded blocks (green) from seen blocks (gray), directly addressing user's clarification about FountainDecoder.decodedBlocks vs seenBlocks
- **Console playground design**: FR-040 through FR-045 specify window.registryPlayground API without dictating UI implementation (aligns with user's preference for console hints over built-in creator)
- **Cross-tab data flow**: FR-048 specifies temporary sessionStorage cleared on unload (privacy-first design)
- **Error messaging standards**: FR-008, FR-031, FR-032 require contextual error messages with recovery guidance
- **CDDL validation strategy**: Future enhancement includes full editor + automatic validation + inline/summary error display, deferred to preserve MVP focus on core workflows

### Potential Clarifications for Planning Phase

While spec is complete, planning phase may need to clarify:

1. **QR library selection**: Multiple candidates (qrcode-generator, qrcode, node-qrcode) - planning should evaluate alphanumeric mode support and bundle size
2. **Registry package lazy loading**: All ur-registry packages add significant bundle size - planning should consider dynamic imports
3. **iOS Safari camera constraints**: Spec assumes MediaDevices API works, but iOS Safari has known camera quirks - planning should include iOS testing strategy
4. **CDDL parser library selection**: For future CDDL validation feature, evaluate cddl-lib, @ipld/schema-gen, or custom parser implementation

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase. No spec updates required.
